Stimuli presentation software

How to use
----------

1. Install psychopy (the standalone package for your Operating System at http://www.psychopy.org/). Please ensure you have version 1.64 or higher installed.

2. Once installed, run psychopy and open a file you wish to use e.g.
training-counterbalanced.py.

3. Click run to view the stimuli presentation (Top right icon of a man running on a green circular background)

4. There should be an output file with your data in if you used either of
the testing scripts.

5. IMPORTANT - Do not run it directly from SWR, drag the testing script onto the desktop and run from there. If you have two or more participants, it may not save properly as only only one user account can access the server at any one time.

File specifics
--------------

Look at the participant_allocation sheet to determine what stimuli
presentation you need.
